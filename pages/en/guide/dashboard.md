#Dashboard
The dashboard gives you an at-a-glance summary of your systems and instances:

##Cost History
This graph tracks your spending on EC2 instances, showing both estimated and optimized costs.

##Global Infrastructure

The globe feature shows you the regions in which you have live instances. Not only is it fun to see all the places in which you 
have instances, but it can also help you keep track of instances you might have forgotten about. 

##System overview
This card keeps track of your current bill for the systems you have "discovered"
within sunshower.io. On this card, you will see the name of your system, 
your current bill in black, and in green, you will see your potential bill if 
you optimize your instance use.

##System count and instance count
The "system count" card reflects the number of systems you have created during the discovery phase. The 
"instance count" shows how many instances you have launched on your AWS account. If you 
have launched additional instances and/or terminated existing instances, you will need
to click the refresh button on either the summary or topology page.
