#Summary
Now that you have discovered your instances, you should see your summary screen every time you navigate to the app. This includes
the globe feature. A small circle will appear over the regions in which you have active instances, which
comes in handy if you thought you terminated your instances in Seoul but you see a circle over South Korea. 

#Topology
Active instances will be displayed in green. 
Pending instances, specifically those in the process of being terminated, will be displayed in yellow.
Terminated instances will be shown in red. 

#Systems
This shows any active systems you are tracking within Sunshower.
