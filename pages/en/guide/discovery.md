# Discovery

During the discovery phase, you will connect your AWS account to the sunshower.io app using a secure vault with a password known only to you. These are the steps to make this happen:

##Step 1:

Click either the "discovery" button or the purple "plus" button under "systems." If this is your first time linking your information, only the "discovery" button will be available to you. 

##Step 2:
Name your system, give it a brief description, and hit the "next" button in the lower righthand corner.</li>
        <li>Create a vault. In the next step, this will be where you "store" your credentials. For now, though, just create your vault, along with your password, a description, and a password hint.</li><br> <em>Sunshower does not store your vault password for security reasons, so we are not able to recover passwords!</em>Your recently created vault should be checked automatically. You will use your password to unlock it; click the lock icon and then click next.</li>
        <li>Now, enter your AWS credentials and click next.</li>
        <li>Congratulations! The basic information for the system you just created should pop up on the screen. <strong>Make sure you click the "finish" button on the bottom right.</strong> This saves the system for you and initiates the optimization process.</li>
      </ol>
